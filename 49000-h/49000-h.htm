<h2>SUSAN COOLIDGE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SARAH CHAUNCEY WOOLSEY (Susan Coolidge)
was born in Cleveland, Ohio, January 29, 1835.
Her father, John M. Woolsey, a New Yorker, had come
to Cleveland to attend to property owned by his father,
and had there met Jane Andrews, a charming and graceful
girl from Connecticut, whom he made his wife.</p>

<p>Their home was on Euclid Avenue, and comprised
about five acres in house-lot, garden, orchard, pasture,
and woodland. Here came into the world a family of
four girls and a boy,—all vigorous and active and full
of life. Sarah was the eldest and the predestined leader
of the little tribe. They grew up as children of that day
did under similar conditions. There was the regular
old-fashioned schooling, not too exacting or strenuous,
and much wholesome out-of-door life. There were
horses and dogs and cattle and birds for the children to
care for and play with, and much climbing and romping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
were permitted in a place where no near neighbors could
be disturbed. To the other children life was a joyous
holiday, diversified with small disappointments and dismays;
but to Sarah the sky and the earth held boundless
anticipations and intentions, and the world was a place
of enchantment.</p>

<p>She was always individual from the moment she first
opened her big brown eyes—passionately loving and
passionately wilful, with heroic intentions and desires,
and with remorse and disappointments in proportion.
Part of the woodland where the axe had not yet done its
work of cutting and clipping was given to the children
for a playground. They called it “Paradise,” and for all
of them it was a place of rapture and mystery. To the
others it was full of hiding places,—to little Sarah the
hiding places were bowers. They looked for eggs and
birds’ nests, and had thrilling encounters with furry wild
creatures, which fled at their approach; but her intercourse
was all with the fairies and elves and gnomes
which peopled the place. After a time they felt the
presence of the fairies too; but it was under the influence
of her enthusiastic imagination, which controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
their own more mundane perceptions. With her for a
leader they often passed into a new world of romance
and adventure and high undertakings. They lived in
battlemented castles, attended by knights and squires,
with danger on all sides met by lofty courage; or they
rode on elephants in India, always on dignified missions,
attended by great pomp and ceremony; or they lived
with fairies, whose gifts might crop up under every
toadstool. To be sure, the elephant on which they
made their proud progress might at other times, stripped
of his trappings, be serviceable as a nursery table,
and the fairy gifts were apt to bear a prosaic resemblance
to certain well-known and well-worn nursery
properties; but invested with the mystery and romance
cast upon them by Sarah’s vivid imagination, the little
band went, as she led them, into the land of dreams,
and felt no incongruity.</p>

<p>Her education went on much as she chose. The
best teachers available were employed, and to each in
turn she became a favorite and interesting pupil; but
though her quick intelligence enabled her to pass excellent
examinations and gave her a foremost place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
her classes, she really assimilated and retained only what
she enjoyed. Mathematics she ignored entirely. All
scientific problems fascinated her by their results; but
she would not open her mind to the processes by which
the results were reached. For languages she had no
predilections, though she used her own with singular
grace and precision, drawing her words from an apparently
limitless vocabulary. Through life this charming
use of language, combined with her keen humor and
sympathetic appreciation of all that makes life stirring
and vital, made her a most fascinating companion.
Her delight in literature was her real education. From
her early youth she revelled in books, reading so rapidly
that it seemed impossible that she could remember what
she read; but, in fact, remembering it all! To have
looked over a poem two or three times was enough to
make it a permanent possession. She devoured history,
biography, romances, and poetry, and with intuitive
judgment and taste revelled in what was really beautiful
and interesting, and discarded the second-rate and
commonplace. She began writing at a very early age,—fairy
stories, verses, and romances,—but she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
published anything until she had reached full maturity.
Meantime she grew to vigorous, active womanhood, full
of interests and friendships and delightful experiences
of one sort and another. She was much loved, and
gave such a wealth of self-forgetting, idolizing, ardent
affection in return that her friends were all lovers. She
drew a circle of loving admirers about her wherever she
went, and was always totally unconscious of the charm
she worked by her very sweet voice and manner, brilliant
fun, and warm sympathy.</p>

<p>The Civil War broke out just as she passed from
girlhood to young womanhood. It aroused in her a
passion of enthusiasm and devotion, and she threw herself
with all her heart and soul into work for the soldiers
at home and afield. In the Soldiers’ Hospital at New
Haven she was an enthusiastic helper, in the wards, or
storeroom, or linen closet, wherever her energy was
most needed. And her leisure was filled with knitting
or sewing or preparing special diet for the sick and
wounded. She was a tireless worker then and ever,
and nature had endowed her with great practical gifts.
She was an excellent cook and an expert needlewoman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
both in plain sewing and the most dainty embroidery,
and all work was done with such rapidity and perfection
that it was a despair for the race of plodders even to
watch her swift achievements.</p>

<p>From New Haven she went to the Convalescent
Hospital established at Portsmouth Grove, and was
one of a band of excellent workers there during the
second year of the war. It was a very developing and
vivid experience, and one which she counted among the
greatest points of interest in her life.</p>

<p>When the war was over, her old career of busy, never-slackening
industry and purpose began again. It was full,
as ever, of friendships which could not possibly claim
more than she was willing to give. She naturally drew
around her the cleverest men and women of her
acquaintance, and her society was sought far and near.</p>

<p>But she did not really begin her life as an author
until a few years later, when in a grove at Bethlehem,
N. H., sitting on a fallen tree, she sketched the outline
of “The New Year’s Bargain.” She had sent a
few fugitive articles to certain magazines before this,
but only now did she take up writing as a real work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
That dainty little book, with its fantastic and graceful
imaginings, was so well received by the public that
she went on in a different vein, through the series of
the “Katy Did” books, where fact and fiction, experience
and fancy, were so blended that it was hardly
possible to say in answer to the eager questionings
of some of her little readers where the one ended
and the other began. Katy found a large audience,
and her biographer went on from children’s books to
verses or historical studies, such as “Old Convent
Days,” or mere editor’s work, like the condensations
of those famous old diaries of Mrs. Delany and Miss
Burney. She was consulting reader for Roberts Company
in the days when the hall-mark of that firm was
a proof of excellence. She was very industrious, but
her literary work never seemed the most absorbing
part of her life. This was partly because of her intense
and vivid interest in the rest of life,—the journeys,
the visits, and above all the friends,—and largely because
she was absolutely devoid of literary vanity or
self-consciousness. She seldom talked of her work or
referred in any way to her success. Her verses found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
a warm welcome in many hearts whose owners were all
unknown to her, and sometimes she acknowledged, with
a sort of tender surprise, that it was a great reward to
have been able to help and encourage others. But
anything like flattery or mere compliment was very
distasteful to her, and she sometimes owned impatiently
that “Susan Coolidge” bored her to death, and she
wished she had never heard of her!</p>

<p>While literature became the chief occupation of her
life, her artistic temperament and love of the beautiful
found expression in many other ways. She instinctively
surrounded herself with beautiful objects and
colors. Her taste was almost unerring, and harmony
of design and softly shaded tints seemed to be her
natural setting. She transformed every room she lived
in, were it for a week only.</p>

<p>She thought little of her drawings in water color.
They were all flower pieces studied from life, and she
was conscious of the little instruction she had received
and her ignorance of technique. But all the same
these lovely panels were a joy to those who were fortunate
enough to possess them. As was once said by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
one who was no mean artist himself, “She can do what
many artists—adepts in technique—fail in. She gives
us the flower in all its life and spirit.” Her china
painting—necessarily more conventional—was still
charming, holding something of her individuality.</p>

<p>This vivid life of purpose and energy and never-failing
zest appeared to bubble up from such an
inexhaustible fountain of vitality that it seemed as
if it might go on for ever. But gradually a shadow
stole over it—not a very dark one at first, but inexorable.
She fought with it, played with it, defied it,
but it was always there! She could not acknowledge
defeat and was always planning for the future with gay
self-confidence; but the shadow grew! By and by
the narrowing limits shut her in her chamber, but
even then she looked out upon the days to come with
undaunted courage. The chamber was not like a sick
room. It was bright with sunshine and the sparkle of
fire, and scented and gay with the flowers she so dearly
loved. Here she read and wrote and saw her many
friends. From hence came words of rejoicing for all
her dear ones who were happy, and words of truest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
sympathy for those who were sad. She was one of the
few people to whom the joys and sorrows of others
are of equal importance to their own. She pondered
over the lives of her friends with never-ending interest,
and gave at every turn and crisis the truest and most
comprehending sympathy. No wonder that so many
warmed hands and hearts by that generous flame!</p>

<p>Slowly the shadow deepened. She was disturbed
by it, but still wrote happily of the future and filled
it with plans and purposes. But one day, April 9,
1905, very gently, Death’s finger touched her. She
was not conscious of pain or trouble, “only a new sensation,”
but she closed her eyes, and without a word
of farewell, was gone away from us.</p>

<p>It is hard to sum up such a life. It was a very
full and happy one. She gave much, but received
much. She loved beauty, and she was always surrounded
by it. She loved friendship, and nobody had
more or better friends. She gave them of her best,
but she drew their best from them. Hers was an ideal
companionship, so full of appreciative interest and sympathy,
so illuminated by wit and humor. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
ardent and eager in her plans of life. Nothing could
exceed the absorption and energy with which she carried
them out. But she accepted disappointment, after a
little struggle, with a gay <i>insouciance</i>. So when the final
defeat came she seemed to resign herself without
struggle to the inevitable, and to those of us who loved
her best it seemed as if that sweet and brilliant and
unwearied spirit had only folded its wings for a moment
before taking a longer and surer flight.</p>

<h2>THE PRICE OF FREYA</h2>

Youth and Hope. While she remained with the gods and fed

shadow rested over the world. Walhalla was of no worth without
Freya.]</p></div>
